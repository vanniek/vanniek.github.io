        <div class="description">
          I'm an undergraduate <b>computer science</b> student at the University of Toronto with a drive to solve complex problems with simple & intuitive solutions. When I'm not working, I enjoy travelling and reading.
          <p>As of now, I'm developing <b>Plan It</b>, a website built with Python and Flask that will allow U of T students to plan out their degree. I am currently working on phase 1 of the project which involves using 
            the open-source API, Cobalt, and web scraping tools (Beautifulsoup) to store course and program data from U of T's academic calendar into a database.
